# 🗺️ Shortest Path – Luxembourg Map

A Java-based application that visualizes the road network of Luxembourg and enables users to interactively find the shortest route between two points using Dijkstra's algorithm. The geographic data is extracted from a detailed XML dataset representing the country's infrastructure. The application features a custom-built graphical user interface that renders the map and allows users to select any two locations with simple mouse clicks. Upon selection, the algorithm calculates and highlights the most efficient path. This project showcases the practical application of graph theory and algorithm design in solving real-world navigation problems.
